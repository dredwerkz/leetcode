Task:

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.


Learnings:

With JS I should look for more opportunities to double up on variable functionality - using k to both iterate through relevant bits of an array and keep a track of the value we want to return is a great example of this.

In Python I need to dive deeper into tools like list comprehension - very good and fast solution to this problem!

C++ I should look into standard library functions more and seek to understand how they interact better!
