Task: 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


Learnings:

Using a hash table containing the index and number is way way way more efficient than iterating through every combination of integers.

It looks like from my research that using maps is probably the most efficient catch-all way to solve this problem across all 3 languages I've tried!

Definitely need to look more into the application of maps as they're probably pretty useful in general :)
